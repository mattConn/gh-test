## Hello

I'm a software developer with a BS in Communications pursuing a BS in Computer Science.

Previously, I worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC.

I'm currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/ssg">static site generator</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/sdl-game">2D game engine</a>.

I also did an independent study on <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/differential-geometry-exercises">differential geometry</a> in Fall 2018.
