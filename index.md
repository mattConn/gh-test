Iâ€™m a software developer with a BS in Communications from The College of Staten Island, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the same college with an anticipated graduation in Spring 2020. Previously, I worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC.

I'm currently looking for a software developer internship, so please contact me at the email below if you're interested in working with me.

I enjoy programming in C++, JavaScript, Julia and Python. I'm currenlty working on a couple of personal projects: a <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/static-site-generator">static site generator</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/sdl-game">2d game engine</a> using SDL2. I also did an independent study on <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/differential-geometry-exercises">differential geometry</a> in Fall 2018.
