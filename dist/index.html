<p>I'm a software developer with a BS in Communications from The College of Staten Island, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the same college with an anticipated graduation in Fall 2020. Previously, I worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC.</p>
<p>I'm currently looking for a software developer internship, so please contact me at the email below if you're interested in working with me.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming in C/C++, JavaScript, Python, and learning new things whenever I can. I'm currently working on a couple of personal projects: a <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/cssg">static site generator</a> written in C and a <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/sdl-game">2D game engine</a> written in C++ that uses SDL2. I also did an independent study on <a href="https://github.com/mattConn/differential-geometry-exercises">differential geometry</a> in Fall 2018.</p>
